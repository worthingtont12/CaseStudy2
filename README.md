# CaseStudy2

We are comparing cities in Texas and Washington and seeing if we can identify cultural differences using twitter data.

# Data
The data set used to test this hypothesis includes tweets issued sporadically by Twitter users residing in the states of Washington and Texas from October 16 to October 25, 2016. In total, we collected over 80,964 tweets that were posted over this time period and tagged with geographic coordinates within the bounds of Washington and Texas.
